					ISRAELI STUDENTS COMBATING ANTISEMITISM
				</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					ISCA Academic Program is a student initiative aimed at preventing and diluting online antisemitism, racism and de-legitimization of the state of Israel. We research, write, comment, report and develop tools to help reduce online hatred as much as possible, with the help of students both from Israel and abroad.

							Participation Overview
						</h5>
						<p>
							Participant Volunteers are the heart of the academic program. They take part in lectures and events, receive close guidance by team leaders and are in charge of creating new projects that help us fight hate. Since there are very few available spaces for this position along with particular skills we are looking for, students have to apply to be a participant volunteer and commit to weekly volunteering hours consisting of various assignments. They receive 2 academic credits for their efforts and upon excellence, might be awarded with a 6000 nis scholarship for another year of volunteering (In accordance with conditions set by the managing staff and the National Union of Israeli Students).

						Volunteering Overview

						Since we have very little room for participant students, we opened the option for Freelance Volunteers. Students who simply want to help out because they care about the cause can register and aid us in thier free time, Freelance Volunteers also increase their chances of being accepted as participants the following year.

									“Coming from Europe, I thought iv'e seen a lot of hate towards Jews in real life. I never realized this phenomenon was so wide spread online and that it is the catalyst for what I experienced on the streets. I remember being really surprised knowing that I can contribute to this struggle as a part of the university curriculum. This will be my second year at ISCA Academic Program, and I truly recommend it to those who are tired of being a passer by. You will not only learn how to identify racism, but also receive tools to actually do something about it - raise awareness and reshape society.”

				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
