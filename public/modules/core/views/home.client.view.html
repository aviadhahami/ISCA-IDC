					Become a Participant Volunteer
				</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>
					 Participant Volunteers are the heart of the academic program. They take part in lectures and events, receive close guidance by team leaders and are in charge of creating new projects that help us fight hate. Since there are very few available spaces for this position along with particular skills we are looking for, students have to apply to be a participant volunteer and commit to weekly volunteering hours consisting of various assignments. They receive 2 academic credits for their efforts and upon excellence, might be awarded with a 6000 nis scholarship for another year of volunteering (In accordance with conditions set by the managing staff and the National Union of Israeli Students).

						 “Coming from Europe, I thought iv'e seen a lot of hate towards Jews in real life. I never realized this phenomenon was so wide spread online and that it is the catalyst for what I experienced on the streets. I remember being really surprised knowing that I can contribute to this struggle as a part of the university curriculum. This will be my second year at ISCA Academic Program, and I truly recommend it to those who are tired of being a passer by. You will not only learn how to identify racism, but also receive tools to actually do something about it - raise awareness and reshape society.”

					Frequently Asked Questions
				</h5>
				<hr>
				<p class="question">
					Why should my university get in on this?
				</p>
				<p class="answer">
					This  program was introduced to the academic world so that there could be a strong and  unimpaired backbone to our cause. Higher education institutes have been working to promote community service and extracurricular activities for the past decade, believing that students can benefit both themselves and their environment by taking part in such actions. With the rise of the virtual world, hatred now spreads faster and in a more destructive way - disguising itself as freedom of speech and mostly comes from anonymous sources. Nevertheless, we are now capable of facing global scale issues. We have the option of researching into how hatred is spread through viral propaganda, disproof prejudice and even establish legal clinics that can help cope with ongoing violations. Antisemetism is on a constant rise. Jews are being beaten in streets and are forced to move in order to avoid ongoing discrimination. We hope to expand into other academic institutions, enroll students that can help with combating these occurrences while gaining academic knowledge that will eventually create a rise in awareness and a decline in unfortunate instances.
