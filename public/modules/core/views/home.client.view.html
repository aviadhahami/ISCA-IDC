									“Coming from Europe, I thought iv'e seen a lot of hate towards Jews in real life. I never realized this phenomenon was so wide spread online and that it is the catalyst for what I experienced on the streets.
									<br>
									I remember being really surprised knowing that I can contribute to this struggle as a part of the university curriculum.
									<br><br>
									This will be my second year at ISCA Academic Program, and I truly recommend it to those who are tired of being a passer by.
									<br>
									You will not only learn how to identify racism, but also receive tools to actually do something about it - raise awareness and reshape society.”

				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
